 We the Members of the Touchdowns for Tattoo Fantasy Football League, in the pursuit of wasting more time than adults should on fake sports, surrender to the arbitrary and capricious nature of Fantasy Football.  We agree to adopt this Constitution as Law, second only to the Will of Tattoo. May the Will of Tattoo be ever in your favor. 

League Commissioner: Kevin Genson (2012-Present)
Current Government System:  Authoritarian Democracy

      <h3>Section I: Meta-Rules</h3>
      <p>
<p>
<span class= "indent">1. Scope and Term </span><br>
This document shall govern the rules of the Touchdowns for Tattoo Fantasy Football League. It shall go into effect upon its date of ratification _________, and will be in effect every year thereafter until the Touchdowns for Tattoo Fantasy Football League dissolves. 
</p>
<p class="bg-dark">
<span class= "indent">2. Platform and Communication</span> <br>
All Player transactions, Matchups, and all other relevant Fantasy Football actions shall take place on ESPNâ€™s fantasy football platform found at http://www.espn.com/fantasy/football/.
</p>
<p>
Communications of all forms (trade offers, trash talk, gifs, and general league discussion) shall remain on, but not be limited to, the Touchdowns for Tattoo Facebook Group. 
</p>
<p>
<span class= "indent">3. Leadership and Delegation of Power</span><br>
The League Commissioner of the Touchdowns for Tattoo shall be a voluntary and non-elected position. Upon ratification of this Constitution, the currently seated League Commissioner accepts Commissioner as a lifelong duty. The duties of the League Commissioner shall be unspecified and unlimited as he is the ambassador to the Will of Tattoo.  The powers of the League Commissioner shall be limitless when applied to Shenanigans, but arbitrarily limited otherwise by popular dissent and general rabble. The only truly undeniable power is the Will of Tattoo. 
</p>
<p>

The current League Commissioner may delegate any task or responsibility related to the League that he or she deems fit to the Unsolicited Assistant to the Commissioner (UAC), formerly known as The Assistant to the Regional Manager (ARM). The UAC has no right to refuse and the patriotic duty to do as they are told. 
</p>
<p>
The League Commissioner is ultimately responsible for everything that happens in the league. The League Commissioner will be given no credit if things go well, while all generic and specific dissatisfaction, anger, and rage will be directed at him if things go wrong. 
</p>
<p>
<span class= "indent">4. Change of Constitution </span><br>
In order to alter this Constitution, a vote must be initiated on an Amendment. The League Commissioner, or a League Committee, may initiate a vote on an Amendment.  Once a vote is initiated, each Team casts a single vote on the Amendment. One Team has one vote regardless of the number of Members on that Team. An Amendment must have a Majority Vote of Teams to pass. 
</p>
<p>
Abstaining is assumed within one (1) week of a non-vote. Voting Extensions are granted by the Commissioner upon application. Only Teams with an Owner that has five (5) or more children are eligible for a Voting Extension. 
</p>
<p>
Exception to Rule 4: The League Commissioner may bypass the voting system if he announces an Amendment and allows one (1) week for a Committee to form in opposition to this Amendment.  Should no Committee form, the Amendment is ratified.
