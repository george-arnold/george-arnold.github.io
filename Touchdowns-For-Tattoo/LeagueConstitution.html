      <h2>Section I: Meta-Rules</h2>
      <p>
<p>
<h3 class="indent">1. Scope and Term </h3>
This document shall govern the rules of the Touchdowns for Tattoo Fantasy Football League. It shall go into effect upon its date of ratification _________, and will be in effect every year thereafter until the Touchdowns for Tattoo Fantasy Football League dissolves. 
</p> <hr><hr>
<p>
<span class= "indent">2. Platform and Communication</span> <br>

<!-- Note to self: Future project-->
<!-- Figure out a way for the data toggle to reference the definitions later in the document so that you only have to change it in one place-->
All <button data-toggle="tooltip" title="an active professional football player in the National Football League" trigger="click"> Player </button> transactions, Matchups, and all other relevant Fantasy Football actions shall take place on ESPN’s fantasy football platform found at http://www.espn.com/fantasy/football/.
<br> <br>
Communications of all forms (trade offers, trash talk, gifs, and general league discussion) shall remain on, but not be limited to, the Touchdowns for Tattoo Facebook Group. 
</p>
<hr><hr>
<p>
<span class= "indent">3. Leadership and Delegation of Power</span><br>
The <button data-toggle="tooltip" title="the unfortunate Member who is responsible for running the League. " trigger="click">League Commissioner</button> of the Touchdowns for Tattoo Fantasy Football League shall be a voluntary and non-elected position. Upon ratification of this Constitution, the currently seated League Commissioner accepts League Commissioner as a lifelong duty. The duties of the League Commissioner shall be unspecified and unlimited as he is the ambassador to the Will of Tattoo.  The powers of the League Commissioner shall be limitless when applied to Shenanigans, but arbitrarily limited otherwise by popular dissent and general rabble. The only truly undeniable power is the Will of Tattoo. 
</p>
<p>

The current League Commissioner has the power to bestow duties to a delegate, but need not because the Unsolicited Assistant to the Commissioner (UAC) (formerly known as The Assistant to the Regional Manager) probably already did it. The UAC has a sworn duty to do stuff he definitely wasn't asked to do.  However, should the League Commissioner bestow a task to the UAC, he/she/me has no right to refuse and the patriotic duty to complete aforementioned duty. 
</p>
<p>
The League Commissioner is ultimately responsible for everything that happens in the league. The League Commissioner will be given no credit if things go well, while all generic and specific dissatisfaction, anger, and rage will be directed at him if things go wrong. 
</p>
<hr><hr>
<p>
<span class= "indent">4. Change of Constitution </span><br>
In order to alter this Constitution, a vote must be initiated on an Amendment. The League Commissioner, or a League Committee, may initiate a vote on an Amendment.  Once a vote is initiated, each Team casts a single vote on the Amendment. One Team has one vote regardless of the number of Members on that Team. An Amendment must have a Majority Vote of Teams to pass. 
</p>
<p>
Abstaining is assumed within one (1) week of a non-vote. Voting Extensions are granted by the Commissioner upon application. Only Teams with an Owner that has five (5) or more children are eligible for a Voting Extension. 
</p>
<p>
Exception to Rule 4: The League Commissioner may bypass the voting system if he announces an Amendment and allows one (1) week for a Committee to form in opposition to this Amendment.  Should no Committee form, the Amendment is ratified.
