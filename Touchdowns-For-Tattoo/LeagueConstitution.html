      <h2>Section I: Meta-Rules</h2>
      <p>


<h3 class="indent">1. Scope and Term </h3>
This document shall govern the rules of the Touchdowns for Tattoo Fantasy Football League. It shall go into effect upon its date of ratification _________, and will be in effect every year thereafter until the Touchdowns for Tattoo Fantasy Football League dissolves. 
</p> <hr><hr>
<h3 class= "indent">2. Platform and Communication</h3>

<!-- Note to self: Future project-->
<!-- Figure out a way for the data toggle to reference the definitions later in the document so that you only have to change it in one place-->
<!-- Look at Button Collapseable/ Reveal in CSS, change string to value, find way to input value from html tag -->
All <button data-toggle="tooltip" title="an active professional football player in the National Football League"  > Player </button> transactions, Matchups, and all other relevant Fantasy Football actions shall take place on ESPN’s fantasy football platform found at http://www.espn.com/fantasy/football/.
<br> <br>
Communications of all forms (trade offers, trash talk, gifs, and general league discussion) shall remain on, but not be limited to, the Touchdowns for Tattoo Facebook Group. 
</p>
<hr><hr>
<p>
<h3 class= "indent">3. Leadership and Delegation of Power</h3>
The <button data-toggle="tooltip" title="the unfortunate Member who is responsible for running the League "  >League Commissioner</button> of the Touchdowns for Tattoo Fantasy Football League shall be a voluntary and non-elected position. Upon ratification of this Constitution, the currently seated League Commissioner accepts League Commissioner as a lifelong duty. The duties of the League Commissioner shall be unspecified and unlimited as he is the ambassador to the <button data-toggle="tooltip" title="Whatever MeeMaw says Goes! No mercy!"  >Will of Tattoo</button>.  The powers of the League Commissioner shall be absolute and unlimited when applied to <button data-toggle="tooltip" title="Collusion, Shadow Governments, Trickery, or Karen posting in the TFT Facebook Group that we should trade players to quote -Beat Kevin- endquote"  >Shenanigans</button>, but arbitrarily limited otherwise by popular dissent and general rabble.  The only truly undeniable power is the Will of Tattoo. 
</p>
<p>

The current League Commissioner has the power to bestow duties to a delegate, but need not because the <button data-toggle="tooltip" title="formerly known as The Assistant to the Regional Manager"  >Unsolicited Assistant to the Commissioner (UAC) </button> already performed said duties. The UAC has a sworn duty to do stuff he definitely wasn't asked to do.  Additionally, should the League Commissioner bestow a task to the UAC, he/she/me has no right to refuse and the patriotic duty to perform aforementioned task. 
</p>
<p>
The League Commissioner is ultimately responsible for everything that happens in the league. The League Commissioner will be given no credit if things go well, while all generic and specific dissatisfaction, anger, and rage will be directed at him if things go wrong. 
</p>
<hr><hr>
<p>
<h3 class= "indent">4. Change of Constitution </h3>
In order to alter this <button data-toggle="tooltip" title="The document you are currently ready">Constitution</button>, a vote must be initiated on an <button data-toggle="tooltip" title="A change to the document you are currently reading"  >Amendment</button>. The League Commissioner, or a <button data-toggle="tooltip" title="Three teams that agree to petition for or against an identical cause"  >League Committee</button>, may initiate a vote on an Amendment.  Once a vote is initiated, each <button data-toggle="tooltip" title="the entity of NFL Players managed by League Members "  >Team </button> casts a single vote on the Amendment. One Team has one vote regardless of the number of Members on that Team. An Amendment must have a <button data-toggle="tooltip" title="more than 50% of Teams that vote, vote in favor.  The commissioners vote breaks all ties.   The minimum number of votes to pass an Amendment regardless of abstaining votes shall be 4. " > Majority Vote of Teams </button> to pass. 
</p>
<p>
Abstaining is assumed within one (1) week of a non-vote. <button data-toggle="tooltip" title="An extension that allows a team additional time to place a vote"> Voting Extensions </button> are granted by the Commissioner upon application. Only Teams with an Owner that has five (5) or more children are eligible for a Voting Extension. 
</p>
<p>
Exception to Rule 4: The League Commissioner may bypass the voting system if he announces an Amendment and allows one (1) week for a League Committee to form in opposition to this Amendment.  Should no League Committee form, the Amendment is ratified. 
</p> 
<br><br>

      <div id="menu2" class="container tab-pane fade"><br>
      <h2>Section II: Stakeholders and Proprietors in League Operations</h2>
      <p>
<p>
<h3 class="indent">5. Membership </h3> 
The total number of Members shall not be limited directly by this Constitution but rather governed directly by the League Commissioner. 

New Members may enter the league based on acceptance by the League Commissioner or a Majority Vote of Members.   
</p> 
<p>
  Members may leave this league at will, but will be shunned by all remaining Members. Membership shall not be limited based on an individual’s race, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, political affiliation, knowledge of the game or <button data-toggle="tooltip" title="Colleen"  >lack thereof</button>. 
  <hr><hr> 
</p>
<h3 class= "indent">6. Ownership of Teams </h3> 
Teams may have <button data-toggle="tooltip" title="When a Team is managed by one(1) Member">Individual Ownership </button>, or <button data-toggle="tooltip" title="When a Team is managed by two(2) Members"> Co-Ownership </button>.  To qualify for Individual Ownership a Member must be a <button data-toggle="tooltip" title="Individual Members when the League was founded who are a Blood relative of Tattoo">Blood-Bound Founding Member</button>, or be related to a Blood-Bound Founding Member through blood or a marriage legally recognized by a State in the United States of America.  Co-Ownership before marriage is frowned upon by the Will of Tattoo(and probably the church), but does not violate the Constitution and is usually overlooked by modern society.  
</p>
<hr><hr>
<p>
<h3 class= "indent">7. Teams</h3>
The leadership and decision-making of Teams shall not be governed by this Constitution, any Member that is not an Individual or Co-Owner of the Team, or any individual that is not a Member of Touchdowns For Tattoo.  


</p>
<p>
There shall be exactly twelve (12) Teams in the Touchdowns for Tattoo Fantasy Football League.  A league with eight (8) Members would be known as The Grandchildren of Tattoo League for Babies. Nine (9) would be implausible. Ten (10) would return us to the <button data-toggle="tooltip" title="The days before Jim and Johnny were Individual Ownership and this league reached a new level of awesome">Dark Days</button>. Eleven (11) would invoke a lawsuit against Shenanigans, and Thirteen (13) is a <button data-toggle="tooltip" title="An action against the unspoken protocols of Fantasy Football">Fantasy Faux Pas </button> and any number greater would be a decision on-par with voting to return the Kicker position.  The number is subject to change by vote, however shall never be an odd number. <br> <br>


    </div> 
    <div id="menu3" class="container tab-pane fade"><br>
      <h2>Section III: Season Operations</h2>

<h3 class="indent">8. The Regular Season </h3> 

The <button data-toggle="tooltip" title="Period of time which starts on week one (1) of the regular season of the National Football League and finishes at the end of week fourteen(14) of the National Football League">Regular Fantasy Season</button> shall be fourteen (14) weeks long. Every week will have six (6) Matchups (Section III, Rule 11)  Each Matchup every week is determined at random at the beginning of the Fantasy Season with one exception: <strong>the Team Owned by Member Sean shall always play the Team Owned by the League Commissioner Kevin in Week 1</strong>. <span class="font-italic"> So it is written, so it said, so it is the Will of Tattoo, and so it is done. </span> <br> <br>
 <hr><hr>

<h3 class= "indent">9. The Fantasy Playoffs </h3> 
The <button data-toggle="tooltip" title="Week fifteen(15) and sixteen(16) of the NFL season">Fantasy Playoffs</button> will occur the two (2) weeks following the Regular Fantasy Season.  There is a three-bracket <button data-toggle="tooltip" title="You lose, YOU'RE DONE! THUNDER DOME BABY!"> Elimination </button> Style play. The Top 4 Ranked Teams will go to the Tattoo Trophy Championship and compete for the <button data-toggle="tooltip" title="The most prestigous award known to mankind">Butterfly Trophy </button>, the bottom 4 to the Charlotte Bowl, and the middle 4 will compete for a lukewarm consolation prize, The Middle Child Trophy.  See Exhibit C for a graphical representation. 

<hr><hr>
<p>
<h3 class= "indent">10. Divisions</h3>
Divisions are stupid.
<hr><hr>

<h3 class="indent">11. Matchups </h3> 
<p>
Each week during the Season a Team will play in a Matchup as mentioned in <button data-toggle="tooltip" title="scroll back up">Section III, Rule 8</button>. During the Matchup, Teams will score points as set out in Exhibit B. The Team in the Matchup that scores the most points shall be declared the winner and awarded a “Win”. The Team in the Matchup that scores the fewest points shall be declared the loser and awarded a “Loss”. 
</p> 
<p>
  The outcome of each Matchup will be decided on the Tuesday after the relevant week games. Stat Corrections can change the outcome of any previously concluded Matchup.  In the event of a tie game, wherein both Teams score the same total points as set out in Section IV Rule 14, the “Win” will be awarded to the Team with the Bench with higher total points. In the almost impossible case that a Bench Score is also tied, each team is awarded ½ of a win. While ESPN does not track this, The<button data-toggle="tooltip" title="Kevin"> League Commissioner </button> will take it into consideration when creating the <<button data-toggle="tooltip" title="for more info on Playoff Brackets see the Extras page">Playoff Bracket</button>.

<hr><hr>

<h3 class= "indent">19. Draft Etiquette</h3>

<p>

If a Member learns of <button data-toggle="tooltip" title="Such a 2nd Round pick Jordy Nelson suffering a Season-Ending ACL Tear #IWILLNEVERFORGET"> Draft-Relevant Information</button> the Day of The Draft, they are obligated to inform all Members of the Touchdowns for Tattoo Fantasy Football League that intend to draft that player. They may opt to inform that Member as late as said Member’s announcement of Player selection, but must say so . 

</p>
<p>
When a Player’s sticker is placed on the board it is an absolute finality. No power, save the gracious Will of Tattoo can reverse a sticker on the board. Warning: Tattoo never sides with a reversal call, she plays cards! She knows, when you put the cards down there’s no taking it back! </p>
